# meteor-angular-jade
Compile Jade templates for use in meteor-angular.

### Prerequisites
For use with angular-meteor only. https://github.com/Urigo/angular-meteor

### Installation
```meteor add civilframe:angular-jade```

### Usage
Name files ending in "*.ng.jade" and they will be compiled to "*.html".

For example, "templates/directives/editUserForm.ng.jade" will be compiled to "templates/directives/editUserForm.html", so you'll want to reference it as such in Angular.
